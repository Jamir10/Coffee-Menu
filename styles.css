/* #4 The p elements are nested in an article element with the class attribute of item. You can style all the p elements nested anywhere in elements with a class named item like this:
.item p { }
Using the above selector, add a display property with value inline-block so the p elements behave more like inline elements.

/*That's closer, but the price didn't stay over on the right. This is because inline-block elements only take up the width of their content
To spread them out, add a width property to the flavor and price class selectors that have a value of 50% each.

/* Check #5 (above) */ 
/*Well that did not work. Styling the p elements as inline-block and placing them on separate lines in the code creates an extra space to the right of the first p element, causing the second one to shift to the next line. One way to fix this is to make each p element's width a little less than 50%
set to 49

/*put flavor p and price p elements in one line and make the width 50%
